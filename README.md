We plan to extract some core ADC endpoints from core API.
Here are some key goals:

1. Expose core ADC endpoints (*OUS, Events, Fields and Users*) with testability in mind
2. High performance (fast!!!) 
3. Deployable in AWS 
4. Authenticate using token/ssl certificate
5. Use gRPC serverless ASP.NET Core API
